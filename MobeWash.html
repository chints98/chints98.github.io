        <h3 class="project-subheading">Introduction</h3>

        <p class="project-content">
          I came onto the MobeWash design team as an intern in Spring 2017, and working part time there helped me flex both my UX research skills and product thinking skills in an industrial setting. Mobewash is a unique company, as it offers a waterless car wash
          (yep, pretty hard to believe) services to people around La Jolla.
        </p>

        <p class="project-content">At first, the company aimed to create a solution for consumers first and perhaps contractors and companies later, but after delving deeper into the potential customer base,
        we found some fascinating insights about these target groups.</p>



        <h3 class="project-subheading">Inital research</h3>

        <p class="project-content">The first aspect of design and development that I advocated was that we first go out into the field, and interview potential customers and clients from the corporate world, so that we knew exactly who we were designing for.</p>

        <p class="project-content">I also performed a <a class="link" href=" https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bOwu7WXbDpfMhRcgRv8H3ca58dnxj6Gl6RhRo5g9GlI/edit#
" target="_blank">competitive analysis</a> of similar applications on the market to discover any potential innovation opportunities.
        </p>
        <p class="project-content">These included</p>
        <p class="project-content">
          <ul>
            <li>The lack of a profile, or saved details, which proves to be a bottleneck and makes the booking process slower</li>
            <li>The lack of options in car washes, whereas we could provide both interior and exterior, in lesser time</li>
            <li> Lack of a clear on boarding process</li>
            <li>Our service being waterless</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h1 class="content-subheading">Some select interview questions</p>
        <p class="project-content">
          <ul>
            <li>Do you get your car washed? If so, how many times a month?</li>
            <li>What do you, as a customer, look for in a car wash?</li>
            <li> How long does a car wash usually take? (Important question as Mobewash can almost halve that time- 15 minute interval) </li>

          </ul>
          <h1 class="content-subheading">Insights and ideation<h1>

            <p class="project-content">This initial research gave us some key insights, one of which included that the company should be designing not for daily consumers as the product owners first assumed, but for people working at
            larger companies, focusing on contract work more than individual customers, because car washes are a niche in the consumer market.</p>

            <p class="project-content">In layman's terms, individual consumers don't see car washes as a day to day necessity, but more of a servicing job.</p>

            <p class="project-content">This example highlighted exactly why we, as designers, must advocate for building empathy and ask the right questions early on in the design process. We need to know who we should be designing for through research,
            not assumptions.</p>

          <p class="project-content">We took these insights, synthesizing them into user personas, storyboards and user flows to prioritize needed features and use cases of the app, making quick paper prototypes and iterating with users.
          </p>

          <!-- Put images of initial storyboards and user flows-->
          <p class="project-content">Here are the features we came up with through initial needfinding, personas and competitive analysis</p>
          <p class="project-content">
            <ul>
              <li>A profile and settings of some kind</li>
              <li>Ability to edit payment options and enter promotion codes</li>
              <li>View current and previous washes (To remind user that they have a wash present)
              </li>
              <li>Ability to book a wash (Clear most important feature of the app, transferred over from last time)
              </li>
              <li>Some sort of ratings system, where there is a feedback loop</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h3 class="project-subheading">Project 2: UI Styleguide</h3>
          <p class="project-content">
            My first actual design project at Mobewash came out of a necessity really. As we were trying to move from wireframes to quick visual mock ups, Myself and the tech lead, Jesse, realized something was off. The iterations, especially from a visual standpoint, lacked
            consistency. Color schemes were all over the place, people weren't following a uniform typography in their designs, using different forms all over, and a definite consistency was lacking in overall design.
          </p>

          <p class="project-content">We needed a UI style guide, or at least a visual framework which would provide consistency in our team's designs</p>

          <p class="project-content">Without this consistency in design, it would create a massive bottleneck for the development team later on, and the designers presently as they didn’t know what font-weight to use when, and just had to make do with whatever they came up with.
            </p>

          <p class="project-content">Also, to bring our visuals to make good use of the Material design guidelines, we needed a coherent set of guidelines so that all the designers were able to convey their ideas in a way that is uniform and consistent.</p>
          <p class="project-content">Therefore, I set out to create a uniformly consistent UI guide to keep all designers on the same page with regards to visual assets.</p>

            <div class="ten columns offset-by-two">
              <img class="u-max-full-width" src="UI_guide.png">
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3 class="project-subheading">Reflection</h3>

          <p class="project-content">Reflecting upon these last few weeks working part time at Mobewash, it was definitely an unexpected experience because I did not do too much in the way of
            pure interaction design, but got sticky in the product detail and user research side of the spectrum. What this did, however, was put me out of my comfort zone and challenged me, as I
            didn't come in with too much research experience. It was awesome to really put my hat as a product thinker on the team in general, as we were able to pinpoint the market we would be best able to
            penetrate. A key learning taken was that good design hits the sweet spot when user experience fuses with clear business goals to create an impactful product. I'm excited for what Mobewash is up to
            next and will be following their progress closely!</p>

          <!--
          <h3 class="project-subheading">Project 2: Booking flow</h3>
          <p class="project-content">The second project I worked on involved the flow of Mobewash's booking process, which was the most important feature in the
          future application!</p>
          <h1 class="content-subheading">North Star</h1>
          <p class="project-content">Create an experience that enables corporate employees to book car washes according to their own convenience.</p>
           <h1 class="content-subheading">Discovery</h1>
        <p class="project-content"></p>

        <p class="project-content">The booking workflow from their web service previously was, selecting a date and time for the wash -> specifying location -> and paying for the wash. The workflow, however, had a fair amount of redundant elements. Testing the service unchanged,
          users did not want to enter details such as name, phone number and e-mail time and time again.
         Diagram here of details section, changeable and unchangeable details
        </p>

        <p class="project-content">Some other insights that we gained from previous user research were
          <ol>
            <li>Users want to know what the car wash entails, and the services we offer.</li>
            <li>Users did not want to enter information on a map, but preferred a nearby landmark or a company building parking lot.</li>
            <li>Users want to know who is washing their car</li>
          </ul>
        </p>


        <p class="project-content">Taking the third point specifically, we were designing for credibility. It was an important part of the booking process to note, and I'm glad I challenged my assumption
        out in the field, as without it, users may not have been willing to use the service.</p>
