        <h3 class="project-subheading">Introduction</h3>

        <p class="project-content">As a UX design intern at PagerDuty, I was tasked with designing a way to view administrator and team based data in a frictionless, usable manner.</p>

        <p class="project-content">I worked in close co-ordination with our team's PM, Justin, our embedded UX designer and mentor, Elliot, and two software engineers.</p>

        <p class="project-content">This was my first experience working on an enterprise product with a plethora of use cases, and I thank PagerDuty for giving me the opportunity to design for such a core product area.</p>

        <p class="project-content">While a lot of user research was done before I came, I synthesized our learnings into personas, and contributed to interaction design, visual design and prototyped the feature to test with users so it was shippable by mid October.</p>





        <h3 class="project-subheading">Understanding the problem</h3>


        <p class="project-content">Team administrators are unable to view and edit, at a high level, what users and objects are part of a parent team’s sub teams, causing confusion in the incident management process </p>

        <p class="project-content">Before I actually sat down and sketched anything out, I conducted an audit of the product at present, and found a few issues that was detracting from our core user goal.</p>

        <p class="project-content">I also referred to previous user interview notes that had been conducted a couple months prior to starting my internship, and gained a key insight into the problem space.</p>


        <p class="project-content">Currently, team managers or administrators need to go to a team's specific sub teams page to view the relevant objects and user information, denying them a high level view of the information from the parent team itself. </p>

        <p class="project-emphasis">Why would team managers want to go to team's specific sub team pages?</p>

        <p class="project-content">The main use case for this feature is for team managers and administrators to view and configure various teams, so that incident management is not an all hands process, but one which is triaged and efficient.</p>

        <p class="project-content">The current workflow causes a lot of friction in the process, as for a relatively simple task, such as adding a new user to a sub team, or adding new escalation policies for both a parent team and specific sub teams. (For example, if there are
          10 sub teams, and the team manager needed to add the same EP to 5 of those sub teams. Currently, they’d have to go on each sub team, and add it manually from there).</p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="twelve columns"><img class="u-max-full-width" src="images/Workflow.jpg"></div>
          <!-- Put refined sketch here-->
          <p class="image-caption">Here's a diagram I sketched out to better understand the workflow</p>
        </div>

        <p class="project-content" style="font-weight: bolder;">The goal here, is to simplify the workflow and reduce friction for our user for a common use case in the product.</p>



        <h3 class="project-subheading">Framing the problem and ideating solutions</h3>



        <p class="project-content">Taking my findings from above, I strived to frame the problems using the “How Might We” method, forcing me to adjust the problem space into an interesting area to explore.
          <p>

            <ul>
              <li class="project-content" style="font-weight: bolder;">How might we surface relevant information at a high level for admins and team managers?

              </li>
              <li class="project-content" style="font-weight: bolder;">How might we better communicate the various team hierarchies involved within advanced permissions?

              </li>
              <li class="project-content" style="font-weight: bolder;">How might we organize this information to avoid confusion?

              </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="project-content">I also sketched out a few ideas I had for a solution to this problem, and I will be going in depth over some of them. An interesting exploration I made was the usage of filters in a global search object, and segmented controls for surfacing
              various team based information in a contextualized way.</p>

            </div>


            <p class="project-subheading">Design decisions</p>

            <p class="project-emphasis">Representing teams within a single view</p>

            <p class="project-content">One of the main objectives of the design was to provide our user with a high level view of all the team related information and objects they could interact with.</p>

            <p class="project-content">I explored a few solutions below, where I go in depth about the tradeoffs of each one, and presents which one we went ahead with.</p>


            <div class="row">
              <div class="twelve columns"><img class="u-max-full-width" src="images/PD-Design-Folder/Sol.B.png"></div>
              <!-- Put refined sketch here-->
              <p class="image-caption">Solution A - two separate data tables</p>
            </div>

            <p class="project-content">For solution A, the explicit copy above the data tables show what the user is viewing at any given time.</p>

            <p class="project-content">However, two different data tables on a single page increases cognitive load for the user, denying them the ability to quickly focus on one particular view between parent and sub team.</p>


            <div class="row">
              <div class="twelve columns"><img class="u-max-full-width" src="images/PD-Design-Folder/Sol.C.png"></div>
              <!-- Put refined sketch here-->
              <p class="image-caption">Solution B - using a global search navigation and advanced filters</p>
            </div>

            <p class="project-content">Solution B presents a filter based solution, with search functions for subteams, object name, and role.</p>

            <p class="project-content">This seemed like an exciting exploration, but was the information contextualized in the right way? What if the user wanted to view only parent team data? What about data only relevant to subteams? These were important considerations to make
              which the solution didn't account for.</p>



            <div class="row">
              <div class="twelve columns"><img class="u-max-full-width" src="images/PD-Design-Folder/Sol.E_users_contextswitch.png"></div>
              <!-- Put refined sketch here-->
              <p class="image-caption">Solution C - utilizing the segmented controls design pattern</p>
            </div>



            <p class="project-content">Solution C, however, leveraged segmented controls as a design pattern, where users could clearly change context in terms of viewing parent team based data or subteam based data.</p>

            <p class="project-content">Segmented controls are a familiar design pattern in mobile usage, also used in enterprise products from Salesforce and Service Now, and I audited their products to evaluate how they work in the enterprise ecosystem.</p>


            <p class="project-content">Segmented controls allow for quick and easy context switching, where a user is able to focus on a particular view, either the parent team or the subteams within.
            </p>

            <p class="project-content">Keeping this in mind, we advanced with solution C as the best course of action for the team view.</p>



            <p class="project-emphasis">Surfacing data in an intuitive way</p>

            <p class="project-content">Another important design decision was to surface data to our users in a way that was scalable, yet helped users to clearly see the team heirarchies involved.</p>




            <div class="row">
              <div class="twelve columns"><img class="u-max-full-width" src="images/PD-Design-Folder/Data_table_a.png"></div>
              <!-- Put refined sketch here-->
              <p class="image-caption">Data table A</p>
            </div>

            <p class="project-content">Solution A — While this works well for a singular user on a team, and they might have a defined role. Also, we must consider the case where a user could be part of a subteam within a subteam (nested subteams), which would cause clutter and
              information density in the table interface, which then increases cognitive load for the admin / team manager</p>




            <div class="row">
              <div class="twelve columns"><img class="u-max-full-width" src="images/PD-Design-Folder/Big_data_table_b.png"></div>
              <!-- Put refined sketch here-->
              <p class="image-caption">Data table B</p>
            </div>


            <p class="project-content">Solution B — creates clear separation between a subteam and a specific role. A user can very well be in different teams in different roles. Scales better when a user is part of nested subteams, for example Peyton Manning, who is part of apl1,
              and the nested subteam apl1-immeadiate
            </p>



            <div class="row">
              <div class="twelve columns"><img class="u-max-full-width" src="images/PD-Design-Folder/Data_table_c.png"></div>
              <!-- Put refined sketch here-->
              <p class="image-caption">Data table C</p>
            </div>

            <p class="project-content">Solution C — View users’ base roles along with team roles, but does this scale well with other objects relevant to subteams?</p>
            <p class="project-content">Logical break, does this fit the users mental model when looking at specific roles? Base vs. team. Also, scalability and consistency issues arise when looking at other non-user objects.
            </p>

            <p class="project-content">Solution B for our data tables fit best as it was highly scalable, and surfaces object data and heirarchies in a way that is unobtrusive to the user, letting them focus on managing incident response more efficiently.</p>

            <p class="project-subheading">Insights from testing</p>

            <p class="project-content">Initial user tests unraveled a few problems with our designs.</p>

            <p class="project-content">Some buttons led to unexpected actions for the user, and there were inconsistencies in some of the data tables.</p>

            <p class="project-content">We also discovered an interesting edge case, where a user is not supposed to add more than one user to another subteam or EP at a given time, due to security constraints.</p>


            <p class="project-content">Armed with these insights from testing, we iterated in parallel, so that we could quickly refine our current designs and present them to more users and additional stakeholders for testing.</p>



            <p class="project-subheading">Iterating in parallel</p>

            <p class="project-content">Iterating and prototyping in parralel helped us with refining our design decisions, as well as creating new explorations considering the feedback we recieved during user testing.</p>

            <p class="project-emphasis">Iteration v1</p>


            <div class="row">
              <div class="twelve columns">
                <video controls style="max-height: 520px;">
                <source src="images/PD-Design-Folder/Iteration-1-prototype.mov">
              </video>
                <p class="image-caption">Iteration 1 flow</p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <p class="project-emphasis">Pros</p>

            <p class="project-content">Segmented controls are a familiar design pattern for organizing different kinds of information.
            </p>




            <p class="project-emphasis">Cons</p>


            <p class="project-content">Admins were confused when selecting multiple users, but only being able to add one.
            </p>


            <p class="project-content"> The two data tables in the “subteams and parent team” view cause cognitive overload with admins not being able to focus on two tables at the same time
            </p>

            <p class="project-content">Visual dissonance with segmented controls taking up the whole screen
            </p>


            <p class="project-content">Inconsistencies with data table - breaks down in edge case scenarios, lack of search bar in one control, but is present in the other. User selection in one data table, but not the other.</p>








            <p class="project-emphasis">Iteration v2</p>



            <div class="row">
              <div class="twelve columns">
                <video controls style="max-height: 520px;">

              </div>
            </div>

            <p class="project-emphasis">Pros</p>

            <p class="project-content">Segmented controls iterated upon to be a contextual switcher, rather than a screen covering distraction
            </p>


            <p class="project-content">Data tables clearly show team hierarchy in all scenarios, including the combined sub teams and parent team view
            </p>


            <p class="project-content">Search function is consistent across all segmented views
            </p>



            <p class="project-emphasis">Cons</p>


            <p class="project-content">Admins were still confused when selecting multiple users, important and fixable issue. </p>


            <p class="project-content">Admins can only change a user's base role from the parent team feature</p>


            <p class="project-subheading">Final design</p>

            <div class="row">
              <div class="twelve columns">
                <video controls style="max-height: 520px;">

                <p class="image-caption">Final interaction flow</p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <p class="project-content">For our final design, we took our learnings from parallel prototyping, taking the best of what the two iterations had, and considered edge case scenarios.</p>

            <p class="project-content">The design includes smaller segmented controls that are scalable in accordance with our design system</p>

            <p class="project-content">Data tables which are clear, scalable and lessen cognitive load</p>

            <p class="project-content">There is clarity in user action while meeting engineering constraints, leading to a simplified workflow in terms of users finding at a high level team based objects.</p>

            <p class="project-subheading">Impact</p>

            <p class="project-content">Final designs validated with user testing sessions</p>

            <p class="project-content">Success metrics included increased number of clicks (by 20%) for segmented controls on Pendo (analytics tool)</p>

            <p class="project-content">13% increase of feature usage against previous design over multivariate testing. </p>

            <p class="project-content">Qualitative surveys validated improvement from previous design, and pitched design to our Product Manager, adopted by the team for product roadmap </p>

            <p class="project-emphasis">Estimated to ship completely by mid-October, although we have released the beta version.</p>

            <p class="project-subheading">Lessons learned</p>

            <p class="project-content">Metrics are your ally in designing the right solution</p>

            <p class="project-content">Design for the happy path first, before diving deeper into edge case scenarios</p>

            <p class="project-content">Communication and collaboration is key</p>
