        <h3 class="project-subheading">Problem</h3>

        <p class="project-content" style="font-weight: bold;">How may I craft a solution that helps both students and young professionals alike to visualize their tasks
        in an alternate and intuitive way?</p>

        <p class="project-content">I use apps like Wunderlist, and some of its features are awesome, such as folders for compartmentalizing your life’s different to-do’s, assigning tasks to others for group projects and etc.</p>

        <p class="project-content">Yet, using the app, or even physical to-do lists for that matter, was that I was unable to visualize my task workflows.</p>

        <p class="project-content">After doing some informal user research at work and with friends in terms of their use for daily to do lists, they too felt that they were unable to
        map progress and adapt their tasks accordingly. In fact, one of my best friends even said that to-do lists even impede productivity after tasks build up overtime, with other tasks being pushed down or neglected.</p>


        <h3 class="project-subheading">Solution</h3>

        <p class="project-content">Taskboard is an iOS app that helps users visualize tasks in an alternative way, taking inspiration from the agile methodology and the Kanban board.
          Now, people can clearly see what tasks are in progress, and what tasks need to be prioritized, while being able to categorize different sets of tasks and add collaborators
          to lists.<p>



        <h3 class="project-subheading">Goals and Defining Values</h3>
        <p class="project-content">I began my design process by writing down some key adjectives that would guide and hopefully describe the application's experience. These would serve as a
        reference point at each milestone, helping me stay on path throughout the process and make decisions with intent.</p>
        <ol>
          <li class="project-content"><a class="project-emphasis">Intuitive:</a>The application should feel like second nature, and the interface needs to be understated to keep focus on the content of the app, tasks.</li>
          <li class="project-content"><a class="project-emphasis">Efficient:</a>People, especially students and young professionals are on a time crunch, so the interactionns for adding tasks and the app itself should be optimized for speed.</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="project-content">I also created an experience map to guide the solution and provide a high level overview of a user's interactions with the app. This also helped me gather key insight over the product's scope,
        keeping me grounded to my goals and defining values and ensuring that I was designing with purpose.</p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="twelve columns"><img class="u-max-full-width" src="images/Task-sketches.jpeg"></div>
          <p class="image-caption">Experience map defining the app's overall experience</p>
        </div>

        <p class="project-subheading">Ideating and exploring different solutions</p>

        <p class="project-content">At first, I aimed to explore different solutions in low fidelity to see how exactly I could visualize tasks in a way that was both
        intuitive and efficient. I wanted to make sure that it didn't represent a massive change to a user's mental model of adding and completing tasks.</p>

        <!-- Put a picture here-->
        <div class="row">
          <div class="twelve columns"><img class="u-max-full-width" src="images/Board-explorations.png"></div>
          <p class="image-caption">Exploring different visualizations for tasks</p>
        </div>

        <p class="project-content">Solution A represents a progress bar layout along with each task, but I quickly realized that the solution was not feasible
        from a usability standpoint (how does the user know their exact progress ahead of time?)</p>
        <p class="project-content"> I then iterated onto Solution B, which represents a linear visualization where tasks are categorized by three points of progess, but there is still cognitive
        overhead for the user in edge case situations (such as a larger build up for tasks in a certain section).</p>
        <p class="project-content">Solution C takes inspiration from the Kanban board, which I utilized in my internship last summer. Asking my PM's, they stated that it helped them prioritize their tasks and keep workflows focused.
        I tested out this exploration with people outside of work, and the feedback was positive, many saying they would prefer such a method.</p>
        <!-- Helps give a bird's eye overview of tasks and lets users map progress in their minds -->

        <p class="project-content">I am also a firm believer of pencil before pixels, as it helps being generative with solutions, so I took the experience map and set out
        to sketch some of the main screens.</p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="twelve columns"><img class="u-max-full-width" src="images/task-wires.jpeg"></div>
          <p class="image-caption">Initial sketches of the main screens.</p>
        </div>

        <p class="project-content">One of the crucial aspects of designing screens is prioritizing information and presenting it in a clear, coherent manner. Under each primary screen, I listed the essential informationI wanted to represent
        in each screen, and then organized the elements into lo-fi design patterns, sketching them on paper.</p>

        <p class="project-subheading">Key interactions and design decisions</p>

        <p class="project-content">As we get ready to move fidelity from low to high, we arrive at a key facet of any application’s user experience, its interactions. I wanted to craft these interactions with care and intentionality.
I broke the application down into four key interactions which really drive the application for the user.</p>

        <p class ="project-emphasis">Adding a new task</p>

        <p class="project-content">The action of adding a task should be incredibly simple to execute and discoverable on the homepage. The interaction
        clearly prompts a user to add a task, and gives an option of adding a due date and comments in grey input text, giving a user affordance and flexibility whilst adding a task.</p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="six columns">
            <img class="u-max-full-width" src="images/Taskboard-pages/adding-task-explore.png" style="max-height: 520px;">
            <p class="image-caption">Modal exploration</p>
          </div>
          <div class="six columns">
            <img class="u-max-full-width" src="images/Taskboard-pages/New Task.png" style="max-height: 520px;">
            <p class="image-caption">Final task exploration, with a full page view</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="project-content">I explored ways a user may be prompted, deciding between a full page and a modal. I opted for the full page as it denotes a separate task and action,
        and a modal just isn't enough real estate when considering edge cases like adding notes, comments, and due dates.</p>

        <!-- Micro interaction to add task kept here.-->
        <div class="row">
        <div class="six columns offset-by-three">
          <video autoplay="auto" loop="loop" style="max-height: 520px;">
            <source src="images/Taskboard-pages/Adding_task.mov">
          </video>
          <p class="image-caption">Interaction for adding a task.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

        <p class ="project-emphasis">Editing a specific task</p>

        <p class="project-content">The editing of tasks should be easy and intuitive, with a simple tap highlighting and opening up the task, as the user can set or change due dates or add comments.</p>

        <!-- Micro interaction shown here!-->
        <div class="row">
        <div class="six columns offset-by-three">
          <video autoplay="auto" loop="loop" style="max-height: 520px;">
            <source src="images/Taskboard-pages/Edit_task.mov">
          </video>
          <p class="image-caption">Interaction for editing tasks.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

        <p class="project-content">To keep this action intuitive and not overbearing, I kept these options as hint texts, so that the user’s flexibility is kept in mind.
        I also wanted to keep the interaction consistent to adding a new task, placing familiarity with the action for the user.</p>

        <p class="project-content"></p>

        <p class ="project-emphasis">Moving a task to the next stage</p>

        <p class="project-content"> The movement of tasks from the stage of to-do to in-progress or done should reward the user for moving onto the next stage.</p>

        <!-- micro interaction shown here! -->
        <div class="row">
        <div class="six columns offset-by-three">
          <video autoplay="auto" loop="loop" style="max-height: 520px;">
            <source src="images/Taskboard-pages/Swipe-final.mov">
          </video>
          <p class="image-caption">Interaction for moving tasks on to the next stage, providing positive feedback for the user for moving ahead.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

        <p class="project-content">To move a task to the next stage, an intuitive swipe to the right moves the task to the right, reminding the user subtly of the new stage of the task. An animation like this gives positive feedback to the user and a sense of progress when completing work.</p>

        <p class ="project-emphasis">Editing a specific list</p>

        <p class="project-content"> More a general interaction than key, but editing a list needed to be simple and always available to the user, which is why I opted for the tab menu display, with the user having the ability to either share the list or edit the list, being able to change the list’s name and add collaborators via e-mail</p>

        <!-- add microinteraction here -->
        <div class="row">
        <div class="six columns offset-by-three">
          <video autoplay="auto" loop="loop" style="max-height: 520px;">
            <source src="images/Taskboard-pages/Edit_list.mov">
          </video>
          <p class="image-caption">Interaction for editing a list, showcasing various options.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

        <p class="project-content">Again, in these screens it was important to keep the consistency of the other screens. This helped maintain visual consistency in the application and lessen cognitive load for the user.</p>


        <p class="project-subheading">Visual design considerations</p>

        <p class="project-content">In terms of visual design, I wanted the application to feel incredibly friendly and calm, as task management is a stressful job as it is. I therefore iterated on the turquoise color, and the logo represents the visualization of the app itself.</p>


        <p class="project-content">One of the considerations I made within the application itself was to make the interface understated and encourage user interaction through clear call to actions and use of icons, while keeping the focus
        on the content of the application.</p>

        <!-- Picture of icons -->
        <div class="row">
        <div class="six columns">
          <img class="u-max-full-width" src="images/Taskboard-pages/Settings Page.png" style="max-height: 520px;" />
          <p class="image-caption">Clear use of icons to guide user interaction and complement calls to action</p>
        </div>
        <div class="six columns">
          <img class="u-max-full-width" src="images/Taskboard-pages/Navigation page.png" style="max-height: 520px;" />
          <p class="image-caption">Clear call to action buttons, driving user engagement and keeping with the iOS human interface guidelines.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

        <p class="project-content">Another consideration I made sure to make, although it seems understated within the app itself is a metaphor mapped to the real world. The cards in the layout make use of
        a subtle shadow to represent depth and a card on a Kanban board. Similarly, the add button is a positive action that motivates the user to add a task.</p>

        <p class="project-content">The design process was definitely not a solitary one, and I sought feedback at the visual design stage too, with my mom commenting on the lack of icons
        to keep the mood light and guide user interactions (she's a designer as well!), and friends commenting on font sizes, I opted to use the iOS system font to keep consistent with their
      human interface guidelines whilst also lending nativity to the app's experience within the iOS ecosystem.</p>
        <!-- Picture of cards themselves.-->
        <div class="row">
        <div class="six columns offset-by-three">
          <img class="u-max-full-width" src="images/Taskboard-pages/Inbox.png" style="max-height: 520px;" />
          <p class="image-caption">View of the Inbox, with a visible card layout representing the Kanban board.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3 class="project-subheading">Prototype</h3>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="twelve columns">
      <iframe width="438px" height="930" src="https://framer.cloud/dkAYy" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>




        <p class="project-subheading">Reflection</p>

        <p class="project-content">Some of my key learnings from designing Taskboard were that</p>
<ol>
<li>Validation is key — It’s never early to test your ideas and interactions out in the field, and this helps quash assumptions on the spot.</li>
<li>Design with intention — Every interaction and action should be crafted with a purpose, as UX is grounded in rationale, not fancy visuals.</li>
<li>Define the scope first, don’t jump head first into sketching — Lending to the point above, defining a scope of the solution helps guide the design forward and gives a clear, achievable north star to aspire to.</li>
</ol>

<p class="project-content">I was also happy to have challenged myself to incorporate motion in my designs through Framer, conveying both interactions and microinteractions in a native manner. Now, I hope to iterate more on Taskboard through testing, and go on to develop the application in Swift.</p>
