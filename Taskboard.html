        <h3 class="project-subheading">Identifying the Problem</h3>


        <p class="project-content">I use apps like Wunderlist to organize the various to-do’s of my life, and some of its features are awesome, such as different List’s compartmentalizing your different to do lists and letting you add collaborators on the list. However, I felt
          frustrated as I was unable to visualize my tasks and properly prioritize and visualize them.</p>

        <p class="project-content">I conducted a bit of informal user research, interviewing friends and colleagues at work, learning that to-do lists might actually be impeding productivity, feeling that they were unable to map progress and adapt their tasks accordingly.</p>

        <p class="project-content">After doing some informal user research at work and with friends in terms of their use for daily to do lists, they too felt that they were unable to map progress and adapt their tasks accordingly. In fact, one of my best friends even said that
          to-do lists impeded his productivity after his tasks build up overtime, with other tasks being pushed down or neglected.</p>

        <p class="project-content">After this informal audit, there were two key problems that stood out.</p>

        <p class="project-content" style="font-weight: bolder;">People are unable to visualize and priorotize their to-do lists.</p>
        <p class="project-content" style="font-weight: bolder;">Buildup of tasks leads to choice paralysis and cognitive overload.</p>


        <h3 class="project-subheading">Framing the problem and setting goals</h3>



        <p class="project-content">Taking my findings from above, I strived to frame the problems using the “How Might We” method, forcing me to adjust the problem into an interesting area to explore.
          <p>

            <ul>
              <li class="project-content" style="font-weight: bolder;">How might we let users visualize tasks in an alternative manner?
              </li>
              <li class="project-content" style="font-weight: bolder;">How might we improve user productivity and motivate people to complete tasks?
              </li>
            </ul>



            <p class="project-content">I first set a few goals and defining words that would hopefully guide and describe the experience of the application’s experience. These would serve as a reference point at each milestone, helping me stay on path throughout the design process.

            </p>

            <p class="project-emphasis">Intuitive</p>
            <p class="project-content">The application should feel like second nature, and the interface needs to be understated to keep focus on the content of the app, tasks.</li>
              <p class="project-emphasis">Efficient</p>
              <p class="project-content">The target audience, students and young professionals are on a time crunch, so the interactions for adding tasks and the app itself should be optimized for speed.</li>



                <p class="project-content">I took a leaf out of Google Venture’s book, by using some aspects of the HEART framework to ask questions that would ultimately define the product’s success. Some of the goals were to</p>

                <ol>
                  <li class="project-content">Measure user attitude based on a short and simple survey
                  </li>
                  <li class="project-content">Measure frequency of use and depth of interaction during user testing (more qualitative and observational in this case).</li>
                  <li class="project-content">Measure time taken to create a task, and go through the core interactions of the app (quantitative, and could give me great insight).</li>
                  <li class="project-content">Measure effectiveness by giving users various tasks and measuring percentage of tasks completed.</li>
                </ol>

                <p class="project-content">Metrics I would consider for testing included</p>

                <ol>
                  <li class="project-content">Speed of task creation, board creation and other functions of the app, which would help optimize for efficiency.
                  </li>
                  <li class="project-content">Effectiveness percentage calculated by giving users various tasks to complete, validating whether the flow of the app is intuitive and effective enough. </li>
                </ol>

                <p class="project-content">Had the product indeed shipped, I would also consider</p>

                <ol>
                  <li class="project-content">Engagement in terms of how number of cards created per day
                  </li>
                  <li class="project-content">Measuring how many tasks get completed on time per user, rather than overdue. This would quantify if the interactions of the app have the intended effect, and would inform me in terms of what direction I should go in for a future iteration.</li>
                </ol>

                <p class="project-content">With these core ideas well defined, I created an experience map to visualize the journey a user would take throughout the app at a high level.

                </p>

                <p class="project-subheading">Exploring potential solutions
                </p>

                <p class="project-content">At first, I aimed to explore different solutions in low fidelity to see how exactly I could model visualizing tasks in a way that was both intuitive and efficient. I wanted to make sure that it didn't represent a massive change to a user's
                  mental model of adding and completing tasks.</p>

                <!-- Put a picture here-->
                <div class="row">

                  <p class="image-caption">Exploring different visualizations for tasks</p>
                </div>


                <p class="project-content">Solution A represents a progress bar layout along with each task, but I quickly realized that the solution was not feasible from a usability standpoint (how does the user know their exact progress ahead of time?)</p>
                <p class="project-content"> I then iterated onto Solution B, which represents a linear visualization where tasks are categorized by three points of progess, but there is still cognitive overhead for the user in edge case situations (such as a larger build up for
                  tasks in a certain section).</p>
                <p class="project-content">Solution C takes inspiration from the Kanban board, which I utilized in my internship last summer. Asking my PM's, they stated that it helped them prioritize their tasks and keep workflows focused. I tested out this exploration with people
                  outside of work, and the feedback was positive, many saying they would prefer such a method.</p>

                <!-- Helps give a bird's eye overview of tasks and lets users map progress in their minds -->

                <p class="project-emphasis">How would this be different from apps like Trello and Asana? Aren’t they based on the Kanban board as well?</p>


                <p class="project-content">Although Asana and Trello are great examples of a scrum board in practice, their original product is focused on project management and the management of teams, with customizable categories. Taskboard aims to be a skinned down and simpler
                  Kanban board implementation which helps users be more productive with three distinct categories.</p>


                <p class="project-subheading">Low Level Design decisions</p>

                <p class="project-content">After picking the Kanban board solution though, a very interesting case arose. Using cards, how can we communicate relevance between all these cards? Imagine if the whole page was filled with cards in one category (for example, to-do).
                  Information still needed to be presented in a way that helps user visualize and prioritize tasks easily. So an important question which arose was</p>

                <p class="project-emphasis">How to represent priority in a simple, yet effective way?</p>

                <p class="project-content">Considering prioritization starts from one of the most important interactions of the application, when a user first creates a task.</p>

                <p class="project-emphasis">Creating a new task</p>

                <p class="project-content">The creation of a new task should take minimal effort, while also being highly discoverable, shown by the add button in the middle of the tab-bar, conforming to iOS human interface guidelines, while still surfacing the key interaction</p>

                  <p class="image-caption">Explorations for creating tasks</p>
                </div>

                <p class="project-content">A:  Provides a clearer CTA to create a task, which drives interaction more seamlessly. Priority and Due date are new actions which the user goes into and are optional.</p>
                <p class="project-content">B:  However, B hides priorities away with the due date, which is still a secondary option for users according to prior research.</p>
                <p class="project-content">C: Optimized for speed, provides context as to where the task is relevant to a specific board</p>

                <p class="project-content">I explored ways a user may be prompted, deciding between a full page and an action sheet. While considering the full page denotes a separate task and action, it seemed viable to go with this approach. However, this doesn't optimize for
                  speed, whereas the action sheet provides context to the user in terms of what board they are creating a task in, is efficient, and doesn't sacrifice usability.</p>

                <p class="project-content">Another critical design decision I had to contend with, however, was the representation of priorities. The radio buttons for choosing priority don't provide as much prominence to a task's priority, where the user can simply not choose
                  one. The product's goal however, is to help users actively prioritize tasks.</p>


                <div class="row">
                  <div class="twelve columns">

                </div>

                <p class="project-content">Therefore, for the final interaction, I leveraged the use of segmented controls to drive interaction when users are prioritizing their tasks, helping them being mindful of the weight they want to place on each task, while doing it in a
                  way that is optimized for efficiency. Exclamation marks, along with the use of intentional color coding, also represented a concretized model of priority that is common with people and created a strong metaphor.</p>

                <p class="project-emphasis">Representing priority on a specific card</p>

                <p class="project-content">There were two important questions I needed to answer when representing information on the card.</p>
                <p class="project-content">How can we represent priority in a contextual way for the user so that it scales well for, say a page full of various cards?</p>

                <p class="project-content">For representing due dates, does it work better to keep exact due dates at all times, or offer contextual hints based on due date (eg: “Due in 3 days”)?</p>

                <p class="project-content">I explored various ways to represent priority, let me walk you through each of them.</p>

                <div class="row">
                  <div class="twelve columns">
                    <img class="u-max-full-width" src="Taskboard-design-assets/Taskboard-card-exploration.png" />
                    <p class="image-caption">Initial explorations for representing priority.</p>
                  </div>
                </div>

                <p class="project-content">While option A and B are similar, B leads to a stronger connection in the case of scalability, when there might be many tasks, and is also more accessible. People found B most promising.</p>

                <p class="project-content">Some users liked option C, with the solid color and has a letter of priority.</p>

                <p class="project-content">I thought most users would like option D as it clearly states a level of priority, but when presented with an interface full of cards, the text felt overwhelming to some, and felt forced rather than contextual.</p>

                <p class="project-content">Therefore, taking the feedback into consideration, I opted for option B as a good way to represent priority on a single card, retaining usability and relevance even when presented with an interface full of these cards.</p>

                <p class="project-content">For due dates, taking the product to users made me gain some valuable insight. A lot of them wholly agreed on the contextual hint idea, and it made sense. An exact date might not signify as much attention to a task as a contextual “Due
                  in 3 days”.</p>

                <!-- Add new picture here -->

                <div class="row">
                  <div class="twelve columns">
                    <img class="u-max-full-width" src="Taskboard-design-assets/Contextual-due-dates.png" />
                    <p class="image-caption">Exploring contextual due dates</p>
                  </div>
                </div>

                <p class="project-content">However, I discovered while talking to PM’s and people that contextual information loses its effectiveness after 6–7 days, leading people to procrastinate.</p>


                <p class="project-content">Therefore, I implemented a solution that would give contextual dates if it was due anywhere between today, tomorrow, and seven days, and opted for the exact date afterward.</p>

                <p class="project-content">I also tried to reduce visual dissonance on the card, reducing the size of the priority marker so it'd scale better, and changing the due date color to a muted gray, which served as an understated reminder to the user.</p>



                <p class="project-content">However, this lead to some problems in terms of the priority's relevance. During testing, users were not exactly aware over what a green dot or a red dot represented. This was also inconsistent with the priority tags I used in a previous
                  exploration for adding a task.</p>

                <p class="project-content">With these problems in mind, I made a final exploration for representing priority on the card, with exclamation marks! They serve well as a metaphor for levels of priority, and mapped well to the users' mental model. This design also addressed
                  the inconsistencies across task creation that I faced earlier, and also simplified priority for users viewing a bunch of cards on a specific board.</p>

                <!-- Add picture of exploration here-->

                  </div>
                </div>


                <p class="project-content">The final interaction is one that encourages users to set a clear priority for their tasks, while representing information on the cards that isn’t overbearing, yet indicates a task’s importance.</p>


                <p class="project-emphasis"> Intentionally motivating task completion through the entry point</p>

                </div>

                <p class="project-content">One problem that pervades any productivity app is that people might lose motivation. So how could I drive engagement in a way that was not jarring to the overall UX of the application.</p>

                <p class="project-content">I explored the use of contextual indicators on the very first page the user sees, taking inspiration from Wunderlist. However, the indicators in Wunderlist show the number of tasks in a list, I approached it a little differently however.</p>

                <p class="project-content">In this page here, the red indicator shows a task that is due in one day, or the day of — drawing attention immediately and driving people to get stuff done.</p>

                <p class="project-content">The number in grey, meanwhile, is the number of tasks left in the to-do column- the user being able to easily view the number of tasks left to start. This piece of information goes back to the original goal of the app, for the user to
                  find and visualize their tasks and ultimately be more productive. This also improves the experience of the application as users don’t have to go through every list to see what tasks are left, instead being able to view all of them at
                  a glance.</p>

                <p class="project-content">The indicators surface meaningful content and drives the user to complete tasks, serving as a subtle reminder while also giving an overview of tasks left without going into a specific list.</p>

                <p class="project-content">Another area I wanted to explore, was to foster good habits in terms of setting goals and following through with them.</p>
                <p class="project-content">Whilst the indicators provide contextual information to users in terms of what tasks are due, and what's on the to-do list, how can we encourage users to set measurable goals and keep them motivated?</p>

                <p class="project-content">Using elements of gamification, I aimed to foster good habits in terms of task completion by providing users stats of how many tasks they've completed throughout the week, as well as the percentage of tasks they have completed that met
                  the due date.</p>

                <p class="project-content">I chose not to present a board by board breakdown of the user's statistics, but instead a higher level breakdown, so that users aren't simply deprioritizing other boards, but are being mindful of all the tasks they set out to complete.
                  This way, users can stay actively motivated, while also being able to reflect on what worked for them throughout the week, and what could be improved.</p>

                <p class="project-content">I also put a message of encouragement on the screen, as a playful way to encourage the user to be more productive with each passing week, but to also be mindful of the amount they are taking on.</p>

                <p class="project-emphasis">Editing a task</p>

                <p class="project-content"> I wanted the action of editing a task to be as simple as possible, but there were some interesting tradeoffs within a seemingly simple flow.</p>

                <div class="row">
                  <div class="four columns">
                    <img class="u-max-full-width" src="Taskboard-design-assets/Edit-task.png">

                  <p class="image-caption">Explorations for editing a task</p>
                </div>

                <p class="project-content">Solution A has a confirmation for when the user makes changes — but is it the most efficient?</p>

                <p class="project-content">Solution B utilizes auto-save, but doesn’t show at what stage of an interaction the user is on. I intentionally didn’t explicitly show new task in the adding task feature because the action sheet offered enough contextual information that
                  a user is creating a new task. However, it might cause the user additonal friction if context is not provided.</p>

                <p class="project-content">Solution C — utilizes autosave and is more explicit that a user is on the editing task stage. Solution C also incorporates the tab bar navigation, serving as another signifier to the user that they are still within a specific board.</p>

                <p class="project-content">Taking these tradeoffs into consideration, I opted for solution C.</p>

                <p class="project-emphasis">Providing feedback through subtle motion</p>

                <p class="project-content">Mobile patterns and microinteractions afford feedback for certain actions, and I intended to leverage these to motivate and gratify a user whenever they made progress on a specific task , which is why I implemented the solution below.</p>

                <p class="project-emphasis">Sharing a board, and the higher level board view</p>


                <div class="row">
                  <div class="six columns">

                  <p class="image-caption">Adding collaborators to a board and a view of the inbox board.</p>
                </div>

                <p class="project-content">A key interaction was to add collaborators on a specific list, and a user is able to share it via either e-mail or their own contacts list. Talking to users and uncovering their needs, a key need was being able to collaborate on certain
                  lists together, for tasks such as apartment shopping, to new movies and TV shows to watch on Netflix this weekend.
                </p>

                <p class="project-content">The board represents a visual high level view, mapping to a Kanban board in real life, with a highly discoverable tab bar for the main interaction, keeping in line with iOS guidelines. I also utilized clear spacing for the three columns,
                  representing three distinct categories of the specific board.</p>

                <p class="project-content"></p>


                <p class="project-subheading">Reflection</p>

                <p class="project-content">Some of my key learnings from designing Taskboard were that</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Validation is key — It’s never early to test your ideas and interactions out in the field, and this helps quash assumptions on the spot.</li>
                  <li>Design with intention — Every interaction and action should be crafted with a purpose, as UX is grounded in rationale, not fancy visuals.</li>
                  <li>Define the scope first, don’t jump head first into sketching — Lending to the point above, defining a scope of the solution helps guide the design forward and gives a clear, achievable north star to aspire to.</li>
                </ol>

                <p class="project-content">I was also happy to have challenged myself to incorporate motion in my designs through Framer, conveying both interactions and microinteractions in a native manner. Now, I hope to iterate more on Taskboard through testing, and go on to
                  develop the application in React Native.</p>
                <p class="project-content">However, I also feel I should have scoped the problem space to more than just the in app experience, perhaps considering the iOS widget center for some interactions that would supplement and enhance the user's experience. I also want to
                  explore the gamification concept more in depth, which would also help the product separate itself from the competition, and provide the users with a novel way to be focused.</p>
