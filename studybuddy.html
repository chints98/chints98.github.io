        <h3 class="project-subheading">Overview</h3>

        <p class="project-content">In the fall of 2016, I, along with a designer friend Rajiv Sancheti, created an iOS application which helps students meet and form effective study groups. We completed this project as a side project to help us put the human-centered design process
          into practice during our freshman year.</p>

          <p class="project-content">My role on the project included early research and interaction design from low to high fidelity, while Rajiv and I
          both collaborated on visual considerations in Figma, a collaborative design tool. It was great having another designer providing a second design eye
        and it helped immensely to be able to bounce ideas off each other.</p>

        <h3 class="project-subheading">Problem</h3>
        <p class="project-emphasis">How do we connect like-minded students studying a subject to clear common doubts and increase mastery of the material at hand?</p>

        <p class="project-content">A common issue at UCSD, and most universities with large student populations, is the fact that students are unable to find a partner to study with, keep themselves motivated, and clear doubts in a certain subject area. An example of this would
          be two students completing their math problem set at a certain location together, clearing doubts and gaining mastery of the subject material.
        </p>

        <p class="project-emphasis">But why would someone want a study partner in the first place?</p>

        <p class="project-content">As a student myself, sometimes I stumble upon certain issues in a niche subject that someone in my dorm has no idea about. Perhaps I’m trying to find the motivation to complete the next problem set. So Rajiv and I figured that other students must
          share these issues as well, and so we tried to design a solution.
        </p>

        <p class="project-content">To validate that my problem was not just singular, I asked every interviewee whether they found the above “use cases” of a study buddy true or not. All of them answered either one or both, confirming that this issue indeed occurs.
        </p>

        <p class="project-emphasis">"Study partners facilitate learning"</p>

        <p class="project-content">As we conducted interviews across campus, we gained insight toward this issue, finding that the reasons for this stem from
        </p>

        <p class="project-content">
          <ul>
            <li>Mismatch in class schedules</li>
            <li>Large class sizes, some to the tune of 450 per lecture!</li>
            <li>Study location preferences (whereas one prefers the library to study, others prefer a coffee shop).</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="project-content">We set ourselves a couple goals and defining values early on, to guide and hopefully describe the application's experience.
          <ul>
            <li>Help a user easily connect with someone to study for a certain subject.</li>
            <li>Make the connecting experience as seamless as possible.</li>
            <li>Create a sense of credibility and trust in the solution through consistency in design, and a verification process at the start.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="project-content">Armed with clear insights from the users and clear defining goals for the solution, we set out to ideate onto the problem space.</p>

        <h3 class="project-subheading">Solution</h3>

        </div>

        <p class="project-content">Study Buddies is an iOS app designed to help people connect with study buddies through the use of location and class based filters.
          People can add classes that they are taking and find study partners at the same school through filters, and are able to connect through text safely and securely.<p>


        <p class="project-subheading">Ideation</p>

        <p class="project-emphasis">Overarching focus of the product-</p>

        <p class="project-content"> To create an experience so that we can help students like us connect with potential study buddies where they ordinarily wouldn’t be able to.

            <img class="u-max-full-width" src="images/Study-Buddy-pages/user-flow.jpg">
            <p class="image-caption">Initial user flow</p>

            <p class="image-caption">Final user flow</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="project-content">We tackled, on a high level, two critical questions. Firstly, how should the user feel when using the application? Secondly, what kind of features can we add to make the act of connecting as seamless as possible?
        </p>

        <p class="project-content">
          After a brainstorm with Rajiv, we arrived at some important key words and “solutions” for the questions.
          <ul>
            <li>Approachable, yet intuitive.</li>
            <li>Filter based system, classes, major, preferred study location.
            </li>
            <li>Results should be presented in a way so that the user can make a quick, yet informed, decision.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="project-content">A particular solution that struck out at an early stage was the inclusion of preferred study location as a feature, or a filter.</p>

        <p class="project-content">It looked a good solution because even in the user research stage, we gained the insight that most people have differing preferences with regard to study locations. For example, one student might prefer a library, while another prefers a coffee
          shop or a lounge environment. Also, some students in under populated majors at our school such as English literature or visual arts don't have the tutoring community that the CS department offers.
        </p>

        <p class="project-emphasis">User flows and wireframes</p>

        <p class="project-content">As we built on these principles, we designed many kinds of user flows which would help us convey a clear mental model to the users.
        </p>

        <p class="project-content">One of them included a step by step profile creation, but stress testing this made us realize that we didn’t offer the user enough freedom to perhaps add classes later on rather than add one straight away.
        </p>

        <p class="project-content">Another example was the lack of a proper homepage in the original flow, which was important for the user to see at a glance the classes they’ve signed up for and any current buddies they have. Stress testing the application made us realize that
          there needs to be a central hub for the user. We realized that an intuitive and simple home page was important for the user to digest this information.
        </p>

        <p class="project-content">Along the way, we used prototypes and tested with ourselves and other users to validate that what worked in our minds also worked on others’ hands.

        <p class="project-subheading">Design decisions and iterations</p>

        <p class="project-content">After we iterated on the basic user flow and had a solid handle on it, we went to work on the specific pages, with the design going in two directions over the anchor of the application, the home page.
        </p>

        <!-- 2 Home pages pictures here!!-->

        <div class="row">
          <div class="six columns">

          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="project-emphasis">Home page</p>

        <p class="project-content">The first page had the information as a list, with the user being able to click for specific information such as profile, previous study buddies, and notifications.</p>

        <p class="project-content">On the flipside however, the second page presents the information in a “hub”, putting the profile and schedule icons on top, so the users can focus on what’s in front of them. As the home page is a hub, the users can see the classes they are in
          and their current buddy status. After validating with our users, we went with the second option, as it gave the user a one-time overview and presented information in a digestible manner.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="project-content">Users are able to search for popular classes in a list view that is consistent with the iOS human interface guidelines, while having the option to add classes that might happen once a year or guest lectures, accounting for an important edge case.</p>

        <p class="project-content">We were able to discover that students required a way where they could find a common professor and also establish the difficulty they were having with the class. That way, a user could either tutor someone else or can get help from another buddy
          based on difficulty. To that end, we implemented the solution on the right.</p>

            <p class="image-caption">Homepage with class info</p>
          </div>
        </div>


        <p class="project-content">Although we first came up with a screen without class information, after testing both internally and with users we realized that a user would want to know what class a particular study buddy is for. We needed to design for edge cases as well.</p>

        <p class="project-content">To present the information intuitively, we came up with the class being next to the buddies name in a lighter visual. This ensured that the user can easily see which class a particular buddy is for, while not distracting from the buddy themselves.</p>

        <p class="project-emphasis">Pending requests</p>

        <!--Put 2 pics here, pending request and notification-->

          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="project-content">We also needed to account for the use case of pending requests to a specific user. Therefore, we presented the information on the homepage so the user can quickly respond to such requests, while also being notified via the notification screen
          on iOS.</p>

        <p class="project-emphasis">Filter System</p>

        <p class="project-content">We came up with a filter system so that search results for users were relevant and streamlined according to their preferences. To that end, the filter settings include categories like preferred study location, major, noise levels, and class difficulty
          (to study with).</p>

        <p class="project-content">We also made the filters present as cards that can be saved and removed depending on the user, saving unnecessary friction in the search process while providing a level of flexibility.</p>

        <p class="project-subheading">Reflection and conclusion</p>

        <p class="project-content">
          As my first design project from the ground up it was a wonderful learning experience to see design as not only making something look pretty, but a framework which can create value and solve a user's problems.
        </p>

        <p class="project-content">From this exercise, I realized the importance of validating my designs, aiming to be as intentional as possible in my solutions. However, I felt that I should have spent more time wireframing and on pencil/paper, as it enables one to be generative about ideas, while also forcing us to focus on the core information, rather than secondary visual details.</p>
