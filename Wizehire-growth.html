        <h3 class="project-subheading">Introduction</h3>
     </div>
     <div class="eight columns">
        <p class="project-content">This project was a growth initiative aiming to better allow SMB (small and medium business) owners who use the Wizehire product for their hiring needs, to invite others facing similar hiring needs in their network. While I co-lead design of the feature, I worked with two product engineers, a writer, and another designer 
        </p>
        <p class="project-content">As my first design project focused on growth, I realized that while it is important to be informed by metrics and data, we should also consider the broader user’s journey, instead of paywalls that could serve to be intrusive to the user and increase churn.
          </p>

          <p class="project-content"style="font-weight: 500;">Hypothesis</p>

          <p class="project-content">If we surface referral options to users at moments of achievement, as well as areas that are discoverable within context, it would allow users to share the value of Wizehire as a product to others within their network, driving new user growth. 
        </p>

         <h3 class="project-subheading">Understanding the Problem</h3>
   
      </div>
      <div class="eight columns">
        
        <p class="project-content"style="font-weight: 500;">Opportunities</p>
        <p class="project-content"><a style="font-weight: 500;">tl;dr:</a> A very small percentage of promoters (2%) are responsible for 90% of the referrals from the Wizehire product, and they make up a very small part of the number of promoters (13%). There are opportunities to surface invites in a more discoverable way so that users can share the product with other friends + family who have hiring needs, while getting $100 off after each friend signs up.  
        </p>

        <p class="project-content"style="font-weight: 500;">NPS scores across the year</p>

        <img class="u-max-full-width image-style" src="images/Wizehire-assets/NPS-scores.png" style="width: 100%">




         <p class="project-content">While it seems surprising that NPS scores started high and kept on fluctuating, just that metric doesn’t tell the whole story, as the response rate sample sizes were small during this period. 
        </p>
         

         <p class="project-content" >At the turn of the year, Wizehire went through a comprehensive redesign, which saw an uptick in both user response rate, as well as the number of active users on the platform. 
        </p>

        <p class="project-content"style="font-weight: 500;">How many referrals have been sent out over the years?</p>





         <p class="project-content">Although the number of referrals isn’t a metric that provides deep trend of invites in the product, a metric that was useful to see an opportunity was a cohort’s (the year a user signed up) propensity to invite.
            </p>

            <img class="u-max-full-width image-style" src="images/Wizehire-assets/Data-table.png" style="width: 100%">






         <p class="project-content" style="font-weight: 500;">How many existing users (promoters) are sending out invites to others on the platform?</p>
         <p class="project-content">Taking a closer look at the number of promoters throughout this two year span since the referral program was launched, they make up 65% of the user population who responded to an NPS survey (response rate: 24%).         </p>

         <p class="project-content" style="font-weight: 500;">However, there were only 51 users who referred 300 people, which is 13% of the overall promoter base out of 2,552 users.         </p>

         <p class="project-content">While referral programs can seem sketchy in a lot of situations, a well designed referral program is one which offers the user a reminder and an incentive as to what they value about the product, which is why we aimed to validate our hypothesis with promoters first.  
        </p>
         <p class="project-content" style="font-weight: 500;">Survey</p>
         <p class="project-content">I sent out a private survey to 40 of the promoters on the product, aiming to validate some of the numbers, with some key questions including</p>
         <ul>
             <li class="project-content">
                Have you ever referred someone to Wizehire? If so, how many times?</li>
                <li class="project-content">
                Where did you access the referral from within the product?</li>

                    <li class="project-content">
                        Was it easy to find the referral page in the product? If not, why so?</li>

                        <li class="project-content">
                            Why did you refer Wizehire?</li>
         </ul>
         <p class="project-content">The main insight from these survey results were that referrals were only easily accessible from the sidebar, with 40% of the users not knowing that they could get to the referrals page through account settings. 90% respondents also validated that they refer Wizehire to friends due to the value they find in the product themselves.</p>
         
         <p class="project-content" style="font-weight: 500;">Auditing the current experience</p>
         <p class="project-content"><a style="font-weight: 500;">tl;dr:</a> An engineer and myself led an audit of the current referral experience. The audit, alongside the survey results helped us realize that most of our users weren’t discovering the referrals feature, whilst the current referrals feature suffered from a lack of consistency. We also analyzed the user’s journey to identify touchpoints and moments of achievement where referrals could possibly be surfaced.
         </p>
 
         <p class="project-content">Myself and a product engineer led an audit on the current referral experience to identify areas of improvement in the referral experience, as well as analyze the different points of entry.</p>

         <img class="u-max-full-width image-style" src="images/Wizehire-assets/Old-dashboard-design.png" style="width: 100%">
         <p class="image-caption">Referral callout surfaced on the dashboard</p>

         <img class="u-max-full-width image-style" src="images/Wizehire-assets/Legacy-referrals.png" style="width: 100%">
         <p class="image-caption">Legacy referrals page that is shown after clicking on the callout link</p>


         
         <p class="project-content">To invite a friend, a user can click on the link in the call-out, but it <a style="font-weight: 500;">leads to the legacy referrals page, whilst the product’s own referrals page is within settings. </a>
        </p>
         <p class="project-content">This inconsistent experience can lead to a lack of context and trust in certain situations, with a lot of users being confused as to why they were lead to a different looking product. 
        </p>
         <p class="project-content">Another problem we identified was the lack of visibility for the referrals program, as it was only accessible with a small call-out in the sidebar navigation.</p>
         <p class="project-content">The referrals page itself is also abstracted away in the information architecture, being housed in the advanced settings page.</p>
         <img class="u-max-full-width image-style" src="images/Wizehire-assets/New-referrals.png" style="width: 100%">
         <p class="image-caption">Referrals page within the product</p>

         
         <p class="project-content" style="font-weight: 500;">The audit along with the survey helped us realize that most of our users weren’t discovering the referrals feature. 
        </p>
         <p class="project-content">I also explored a user’s journey throughout using Wizehire to identify key touchpoints in their journey where they achieve their goal in terms of using the product, and what features they use the most. This helped us set principles for the referral experience that would serve as a north star for the project.</p>
         <p class="project-content">Note: I am currently unable to showcase the diagram due to an NDA signed with the company, however the insights our team gained were instrumental in setting goals for the entire experience, as well as informed us as we designed various user flows for the experience.</p>
         <p class="project-content" style="font-weight: 500;">Some of the key touchpoints in the experience included</p>
         <ul>
            <li class="project-content">
                When the user makes a hire within the ATS</li>
               <li class="project-content">

           <p class="project-content" style="font-weight: 500;">Principles</p>
           <p class="project-content">We set ourselves principles or key experience goals that would guide our designs and ensure that we stayed in scope.</p>
           <ul>
            <li class="project-content">
                Easily accessible, but not intrusive</li>

        </ul>

        <p class="project-content" style="font-weight: 500;">What does success look like?</p>

        <p class="project-content">An increase in the percentage of invites sent out on the platform(propensity to refer should be in the 0.5-0.6 range.

                    <p class="project-content-bold">Considering the user flow diagram above, what would the call out link to? Would it be the existing referral page? Or would we surface a modal?</p>
                    <p class="project-content">After discussing this idea with our product team, we realized that surfacing a modal each time a user clicks on a callout interrupts the flow of a user within the product, while it is too little screen estate to show metrics such as amount of credits earned and number of friends invited.</p>
                    <p class="project-content">Therefore, we decided that all touchpoints would lead to the referrals page itself, with that being the users’ intent.</p>

                 <p class="project-content-bold">
                        We hypothesized that if we surface referral options to users at moments of achievement, as well as areas that are discoverable within context, it would allow users to share Wizehire as a product to others within their network more easily.

                    <p class="project-content">The experiment was a success, resulting in a relative lift of 20% of existing promoters within 3 weeks of launch. The plan is to launch the experience to all users, and iterate on UI and copy according to analytics data with more users, as well as observe other areas of potential impact within the users' journey.</p>

                        <p class="project-content">The plan is to set up another growth experiment to see how it would influence the metrics, and I had a chance to work on some early screens of how we can surface referrals within these pages.</p>
