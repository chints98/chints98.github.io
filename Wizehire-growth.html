        <h3 class="project-subheading">Introduction</h3>
     </div>
     <div class="eight columns">
        <p class="project-content">This project was a growth initiative aiming to better allow SMB (small and medium business) owners who use the Wizehire product for their hiring needs, to invite others facing similar hiring needs in their network. While I co-lead design of the feature, I worked with two product engineers, a writer, and another designer 
        </p>
        <p class="project-content">As my first design project focused on growth, I realized that while it is important to be informed by metrics and data, we should also consider the broader user’s journey, instead of paywalls that could serve to be intrusive to the user and increase churn.
          </p>

          <p class="project-content"style="font-weight: 500;">Hypothesis</p>

          <p class="project-content">If we surface referral options to users at moments of achievement, as well as areas that are discoverable within context, it would allow users to share the value of Wizehire as a product to others within their network, driving new user growth. 
        </p>

         <h3 class="project-subheading">Understanding the Problem</h3>
   
      </div>
      <div class="eight columns">
        
        <p class="project-content"style="font-weight: 500;">Opportunities</p>
        <p class="project-content"><a style="font-weight: 500;">tl;dr:</a> A very small percentage of promoters (2%) are responsible for 90% of the referrals from the Wizehire product, and they make up a very small part of the number of promoters (13%). There are opportunities to surface invites in a more discoverable way so that users can share the product with other friends + family who have hiring needs, while getting $100 off after each friend signs up.  
        </p>

        <p class="project-content"style="font-weight: 500;">NPS scores across the year</p>

        <!-- IMAGE HERE--> 




         <p class="project-content">While it seems surprising that NPS scores started high and kept on fluctuating, just that metric doesn’t tell the whole story, as the response rate sample sizes were small during this period. 
        </p>
         

         <p class="project-content" >At the turn of the year, Wizehire went through a comprehensive redesign, which saw an uptick in both user response rate, as well as the number of active users on the platform. 
        </p>

        <p class="project-content"style="font-weight: 500;">How many referrals have been sent out over the years?</p>





         <p class="project-content">Although the number of referrals isn’t a metric that provides deep trend of invites in the product, a metric that was useful to see an opportunity was a cohort’s (the year a user signed up) propensity to invite.
            </p>

            <!-- IMAGE HERE -->





         <p class="project-content" style="font-weight: 500;">How many existing users (promoters) are sending out invites to others on the platform?</p>
         <p class="project-content">Taking a closer look at the number of promoters throughout this two year span since the referral program was launched, they make up 65% of the user population who responded to an NPS survey (response rate: 24%).         </p>

         <p class="project-content">However, there were only 51 users who referred 300 people, which is 13% of the overall promoter base out of 2,552 users.         </p>

           <p class="project-content" style="font-weight: 500;">Why this metric?</p>
           <p class="project-content">We observed through our analytics tool (Pendo), that while 80% of our users were landing on this feature, over time, they resorted to using the alternate workflow mentioned above (going through individual objects)</p>
           <p class="project-content">This would help us measure if our redesign effectively reduced the friction that our users faced during this process.</p>

               <p class="project-content">One of the main objectives of the design was to provide our user with a high level view of all the team related information and objects they could interact with. 
                </p>
                <p class="project-content">This was to ensure that the information users were looking at was easily scannable and would help them make incident management decisions efficiently. 
                  </p>
                <p class="project-content">To this end, I made a few explorations that would hopefully aid us in achieving this goal.

                  </p>
                <p class="project-content">However, I hypothesized that two different data tables on a single page increases cognitive load for the user, denying them the ability to quickly focus on one particular view between parent and sub team. This was something we definitely wanted to test.
                  </p>

                <p class="image-caption">Solution B - tag based search and filter
                  </p>
                <p class="project-content">Solution B presents a tag based filter solution, with search functions for subteams, object name, and role.
                  </p>
                <p class="project-content">However, there were some important questions that needed to be answered.
                  </p>
                <p class="project-content">Would the information contextualized in the right way? 
                  </p>
                <p class="project-content">There was a definite tradeoff b/w granular info and control vs. speed, which was the main intent for simplifying the workflow anyways. 
                  </p>
                <p class="project-content">After touching base with engineering, a constraint was that we had never implemented tag based search and filter before, and engineers had other high priority tickets at the time, which led us to iterate on other concepts. 
                  </p>
                  <img class="u-max-full-width" src="images/PD-Design-Folder/Sol.E_users_contextswitch.png"style="padding-top: 32px;">

                <p class="image-caption">Solution C - segmented controls</p>
                <p class="project-content">Solution C, however, leveraged segmented controls as a design pattern, where users could clearly change context in terms of viewing parent team based data or subteam based data.
                  </p>
                <p class="project-content">Segmented controls allow for quick and easy context switching, where a user is able to focus on a particular view, either the parent team or the subteams within.</p>

                <p class="project-content">To implement, I audited best practice usage of segmented controls in enterprise apps such as Salesforce and ServiceNow to inform our design</p>
                <p class="project-content">Keeping this in mind, we advanced with solution C as the best course of action for the team view, with the goal of testing out solution A for the case where the administrator would want to view both parent teams and sub-teams.</p>
                
               <p class="project-content" style="font-weight: 500;">Surfacing data in an intuitive way</p>
               <p class="project-content">Another important design decision was to surface data to our users in a way that was scalable, and the goal was to help users to clearly see the team and sub team hierarchies involved.</p>
               <img class="u-max-full-width" src="images/PD-Design-Folder/Data_table_a.png"style="padding-top: 32px;">

               <p class="image-caption">Solution A - Data table with team role and subteam combined</p>                
                <p class="project-content">While this solution works well for a singular user on a team when they might have a defined role. However, we must consider the case where a user could be part of a subteam within a subteam (nested subteams). Would this cause information overload?
</p>
                <p class="project-content">The main question here was whether this would scale for such a case, something that we’d only be able to test with real users.
                  </p>
                
                  <img class="u-max-full-width" src="images/PD-Design-Folder/Big_data_table_b.png"style="padding-top: 32px;">

                  <p class="image-caption">Solution B - Data table with team role in a separate column</p>                
                  <p class="project-content">Essentially, this solution aimed to abstract the two key data points(roles and subteams), with the design intent that it'd provide clear separation between a subteam and specific roles a user might have.</p>
               
                <p class="project-content">It made logical sense from an administrator standpoint, as it is even more explicit what user or object is in a subteam, guiding the user in their intent to select and view based on their subteam-based role, while being more scalable/consistent for other objects such as Escalation policies and integrations. </p>
               
                <img class="u-max-full-width" src="images/PD-Design-Folder/Data_table_c.png"style="padding-top: 32px;">

                <p class="image-caption">Solution C - data table with base and subteam roles in a single columns</p>                
                <p class="project-content">This allowed administrators to view users’ base roles along with team roles, but did this scale well with other objects (Escalation Policies, integrations) relevant to subteams? </p>
                <p class="project-content">After looking back at user interview notes, we realized that administrators weren’t looking at base roles when making decisions, but rather team specific roles to triage incident management. 
                  </p>
                <p class="project-content" style="font-weight: 500;">We went with Solution B for our data tables as it was highly scalable, surfacing both object data and heirarchies in a way that is unobtrusive and explicit to the user, especially when tested against Solution A.</p>
