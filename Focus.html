        <p class="project-content">
          Focus Imaging and research center is a medical company and diagnostic center in India. This past summer, the company approached me to redesign their website to increase online presence and differentiate itself from the highly competitive medical market
          in India.
        </p>

        <h3 class="project-subheading">Achievements</h3>

        <p class="project-content">
          <ul>
            <li>Created a responsive, converting website <a class="link" href="https://chints98.github.io/Focus/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
            <li>Bookings saw a 150% increase within the first two weeks of website launch.</li>
          </ul>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="project-subheading">Problem</p>

        <p class="project-content">
          The diagnostic center field is incredibly competitive in the NCR region near New Delhi. Most company websites in the industry are either outdated, and are unable to build any sort of initial rapport with potential patients. During this time
          <ul>
            <li>Focus was suffering through a lean spell because of a low presence online and emergence of regional competitors.</li>
            <li>The diagnostic center space itself had been suffering for some time due to recent economic problems in India.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h3 class="project-subheading">Solution</h3>

        <p class="project-content">Differentiate Focus Imaging from its competitors through a clean website showcasing its diversity of services and reputation of excellence over the years.</p>

        <h3 class="project-subheading">Research</h3>

        <p class="project-content">I conducted interviews with the client and other similar diagnostic centers, discussing what one looks for on a diagnostic center’s website. As the old site had no analytics, I was unable to pinpoint site traffic.</p>

        <p class="project-content">I discovered that patients always visit the center’s website to see the range of services offered, whether it be radiology or other peripheral services. Also, as with other industries, patients look for reputation. If a center has key accreditations
          from the healthcare boards such as NABH and has done impressive work with well-known clients and panels, they’re more likely to book an appointment or refer a patient</p>

        <p class="project-emphasis">Client Research</p>

        <p class="project-content">In order to differentiate Focus from its competition, I conducted interviews looking for the main differentiating features. Since the services section was the most important, I dug deeper to see what would make this section unique when compared
          to other competitors.</p>

        <p class="project-content">
          <ul>
            <li>History of innovation — Focus was the earliest adopter of the 3 Tesla MRI machine, which ensures better image quality and ultimately, better diagnosis for patients.</li>
            <li>Diversified services — Whilst most companies offer just radiological tests and diagnosis, Focus offers both radiology and an in-house pathology lab. The key reason for this, an executive said, was so patients would not have to worry about
              getting key tests done elsewhere. This ends up saving much needed time for them.</li>
            <li>Big-name customers — Focus has worked with both government and private boards such as CGHS, MCD, and BSF on their panel as clients</li>
          </ul>
        </p>


        <h3 class="project-subheading">Website goal</h3>
        <p class="project-content">The goal of the website was to convince the visitor / patient to either book an appointment or get in contact with Focus Imaging. A peripheral goal of the website was for patients to access online reporting.</p>

        <h3 class="project-subheading">Website overview</h3>

        <p class="project-emphasis">Desktop Home page</p>

        <div class="row" style="padding: 20px;">
          <div class="twelve columns">
            <img class="u-max-full-width" src="images/desktop-wireframe.png">
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="project-emphasis">Radiology modal</p>

        <div class="row" style="padding: 20px;">
          <div class="twelve columns">
            <img class="u-max-full-width" src="images/radiology-modal.png">
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="project-emphasis">Pathology modal</p>

        <div class="row" style="padding: 20px;">
          <div class="twelve columns">
            <img class="u-max-full-width" src="images/Pathology-modal.png">
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="project-emphasis">Mobile</p>

        <div class="row" style="padding: 20px;">
          <div class="twelve columns">
            <img class="u-max-full-width" src="images/Mobile-wireframes.png">
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3 class="project-subheading">Design Decisions and UX</h3>
        <p class="project-content">I wanted the website to be simple and efficient in terms of navigation and usability. The idea was that the patient or visitor lands on the page and only needs to scroll down and click to see everything.</p>
        <p class="project-content">Firstly, I clearly divided the company’s services into <a style="font-weight: bold;">radiology</a> and <a style="font-weight: bold;">pathology</a>, because a client goal was to increase awareness of its pathology services being in-house, an important
          difference when compared to competitors.</p>


        <p class="project-content">To that end, as the radiology and pathology section required more information, I made the decision to put them into full page <a style="font-weight: bold;">modals</a> instead of separate pages. This way, a patient is able to scroll down, click
          on a button to learn more from the modals, and then exit the modal to find themselves back at the same place on the main page. Therefore, there is <a style="font-weight: bold;">no page refresh or unnecessary scrolling</a>, and the experience
          is one smooth flow.</p>

          <div class="row" style="padding: 20px;">
            <div class="twelve columns">
              <img class="u-max-full-width" src="modal-screen.png">
            </div>
          </div>


        <h3 class="project-subheading">Branding and UI</h3>
        <div class="row" style="padding: 20px;">
          <div class="twelve columns">
            <img class="u-max-full-width" src="Branding.png">
          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="project-content">Due to branding constraints, I was unable to alter the main blue, so I grouped it with other calmer colors that complimented blue and gave the palette a modern look. The hero page has a playful illustration giving a peek into the radiologist’s
          workflow, keeping the patient at ease.</p>

        <p class="project-content">I chose the font Lato for its readability and professional look fit for a professional medical service.</p>

        <h3 class="project-subheading">Final designs</h3>

        <div class="row" style="padding: 20px;">
          <div class="six columns">
            <img class="u-max-full-width" src="images/Homepage-wireframe.png">
          </div>
          <div class="four columns offset-by-two">
            <img class="u-max-full-width" src="images/Mobile-Homepage.png">
          </div>
        </div>


        <h3 class="project-subheading">Takeaways</h3>

        <p class="project-content">Even though I prototyped the concept of the radiology and pathology services as a modal, the content was far from the final piece. I wasn’t provided enough copy for the services part of the redesign. However, I overcame this problem to the best of my abilities by putting placeholder text that the IT employee is able to easily read and edit! This makes sure that handoff is as seamless as possible.</p>

        <p class="project-content">As one of my first client projects, it was interesting working under deadlines and designing with business constraints, giving me a taste of both product design and development other than

        personal projects.</p>

        <p class="project-content">One key takeaway that I learnt from this project, and will aim to apply this in further work, is to design with real copy and data. While Lorem Ipsum has its pros for rapidly iterating,
        once I put my developer hat on, I had to make tweaks and adjustments to make sure that copy was communicated effectively. Copywriting in itself is a broad field, but an understanding of it goes a long way when discussing
        work with clients and developers.</p>
        <p class="project-content">Overall, I was fairly happy with the project as it allowed me to fuse my passion for engineering and design, going from conception to development of the website. </p>
